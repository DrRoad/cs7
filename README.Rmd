## Welcome to cs7

This is the online, up-to-date home for the course *Intermediate and Advanced R for Spatial Data Analysis*.

It is also a *metapackage* in the sense that when you install it, many of the packages the tutorials depend on will be installed on your computer. Because this metapackage is not on CRAN, we use the **devtools** package to install it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(!require(devtools))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("robinlovelace/cs7")
```

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course participants will:

- Be more efficient general R programmers
- Understand standard (non-spatial) data structures and how to subset, process and analyse them
- Understand the structure of spatial data in R
- Be able to query, subset and analyse spatial objects
- Have a working knowledge of fundamental GIS functions such as changing projections
- Be proficient in the use of R to create maps using add-on packages such as tmap
- Have some experience with advanced functionality such as raster data and interactive maps
